Description: Functions for predicting the optimal time to spend
    learning about a species' habitat that maximizes the proportion 
    correctly identified, under different assumptions about the shape 
    of learning curves and rates of habitat loss or population decline. 
    Implementation of the analysis presented in the manuscript 
    Camaclang, et al. (2021) "Predicting the optimal amount of time to spend 
    learning before designating protected habitat for threatened species."
